QF_CDESK_DEFAULT="This is the fastest and most dynamic way in most cases. All calculation logic is located in the settings of each field, and contains a segment of the final mathematical string. By dynamically adding or removing fields, or changing the value, the user changes the resulting string of the calculator. The following characters can be used in this: 0-9()-.+<>!=:?*/|%&v.<br /><br />The advantage of this method is that there is no formula and no dependence on the field id. Accordingly, you can use the same field many times in the same form in different places and with different values. Or vice versa, use different fields with different mathematics in the same place of the form, changing them dynamically. Your task is to correctly place the brackets without causing calculation errors. This logic is ideal for a dynamic calculator involving dependent fields or cloning them. It is possible to set conditions like if else using dependent fields, or by writing +(v>10?v:10) in field. Hidden fields can be used to write more complex logic.<br /><br />This method calculates only one result. Parts are cancatenated into the resulting string in the same way as the fields in the form are arranged one after the other. This method is poorly suited if the calculation must include the field twice, for example, x*(x+y)+y*(x+y), where x and y are the «v» values from different fields."

QF_CDESK_MULTIPL="This method also exports mathematical logic to the settings of the fields themselves. The difference is the presence of a setting formula and the ability to display several results of the calculator, the ability to change the order of fields, the ability to use fields selectively, the ability to use one field several times, for example, 3.4={2.2}*{1.1}+{2.3}*{1.1}, the ability to add math to the formula.<br /><br />Set the following formula 4.31={4.25}{4.27}*2+({3.15}+{1.25}){4.2}, where 4.31= is fieldid calculatorSum. {4.25} - fieldid, that will replace the value from the settings (number or mathematical expression). Semicolon - formula separator. Keep in mind that if the same field is encountered several times with a different value (for example, displayed by a dependent field), then the latter will be used. If the field is not found, it will be ignored.<br /><br />To display several results, use the following formula:<br /><br />width={4.27}{3.15};<br />4.25=({7.0} >= 10?100:200){7.1};<br />4.58={4.25}{4.27}{4.25}+{width};<br />5.7=3.14*{3.16}*{3.16}/2+{4.25}({4.27}||{2.15});<br />9.12={width}*{5.7}<br /><br />In this method, you can use simple operators: 0-9()-.+<>!=:?*/|%&. The disadvantage of this method is the connection with the field id, which makes it difficult to use a dynamic calculator. For example, a user clones a group of fields. In this case, several fields with the same id appear. The user enters different values, but the calculator takes only one into account."

QF_CDESK_SIMPLE="This type follows the usual common logic. It completely transfers mathematics into a formula. Instead of mathematical expressions in «math», you need to enter the name of the variable. For example, «width» in the first box and «height» in the second. The formula for calculating half the area will then look like this: 4.31 = {width}*{height}/2. Formula for calculating the area of a circle: 4.32 = 3.14*{d}*{d}/4, where d is a variable assigned to a field with a diameter.<br /><br />The disadvantage is that the calculator only calculates input fields of type number, text, range.<br /><br />Like the previous one, this method can show several results. To do this, you need to display the calculatorSum functional field several times. In this method, you can use simple operators: 0-9()-.+<>!=:?*/|%&"

QF_CDESK_CUSTOM="All previous calculators calculate on the client's computer, and after sending, they check it by recalculating the fields on the server. The proposed method always counts on the server, sending a request with ajax every time the form is changed. Formula directly in php. It is enough to write only include ("path to the file with logic") into the formula. This option is the most functional, but requires knowledge of the language.<br /><br />Example of a cone calculation:"
