QF_CDESK_DEFAULT="This is the fastest and most dynamic way in most cases. The entire calculation logic is located in the settings of the fields themselves, each of which contains a segment of the resulting mathematical string. Dynamically embedding and removing fields, or changing the value, the user changes the final line of calculator calculation. In this line, you can use the characters: +, *, /, -, ), (, v, ., 0-9.<br /><br />This method is suitable for trade calculations, which, as a rule, include simple operations: add, multiply. Your task is to correctly place the brackets, without causing calculation errors. It is possible to set if type conditions using the qfincluder function field. To write more complex logic, you can use hidden fields (hidden for display in the letter, this does not affect the calculator).<br /><br />This method calculates only one result. Adding parts to one mathematical line is the same as the fields are located in the form, one after the other. This method will not work if, according to the logic of the calculation, one field is used several times (but here you can use the js and hidden field). If you want to see a common calculation line, substitute two points together in the text field used by the calculator."
QF_CDESK_MULTIPL="This method as well as the previous one, makes the basic mathematical logic in the settings of the fields themselves. The difference is the ability to display several results of a calculator, the ability to change the order of fields, the ability to use fields selectively, the ability to use one field several times, the ability to add mathematics in the formula itself.<br /><br />Set the following formula 4.31={4.25}{4.27}*2+({3.15}+{1.25}){4.2}, where 4.31= is fieldid calculatorSum. {4.25} - fieldid, that will replace the value from the settings (number or mathematical expression). Point-comma - formula separator. Keep in mind that if in the final form the same field occurs several times with a different value (for example, entered by the user), the latter will be involved. And if the field is not found, it will be ignored.<br /><br />To display several results, use the following formula:<br />4.25={4.29}{4.27}{3.15};<br />4.58={4.25}{4.27}{4.25};<br />5.7=3.14*{3.16}*{3.16}/2+{4.25}{4.27}{2.15}<br /><br /> In this method, you can use only simple operators: +, *, -, /, (,). Keep in mind that QuickForm is a dynamic form and the calculation function is launched not by the formula, but by the calculatorSum field, after it is visually displayed on the page. The formula is only a record of the algorithm by which the calculation will be made."
QF_CDESK_SIMPLE="Unlike the previous two calculators, this one completely transfers the mathematical logic to the formula. Instead of mathematical expressions in the settings of the fields, there you need to enter the name of the variable. For example, width in the first field and height in the second. The formula for calculating half the area will then look like this: 4.31 = {width}*{height}/2. The formula for calculating the area of a circle will take the form: 4.32 = 3.14*{d}*{d}/4, where d is a variable assigned to a field with a diameter.<br /><br /> This is the most visual way for simple calculators. However, this is not always compatible with forms using drop-down fields. In addition, this calculator counts only input fields of type number, text, range.<br /><br />Like the previous version, this method can display several results. To do this, you need to display the functional field calculatorSum several times. In this method, you can use only simple operators: +,*,-,/,(,)."
QF_CDESK_CUSTOM="All previous calculators consider the form on js on the client’s computer, and after sending it, they verify it by recounting it on the server. The proposed method always counts on the server, sending the request as an Ajax each time a form changes. The calculation formula is written directly in the php language. This option is the most functional, but requires knowledge of the language.<br /><br />Example of a cone calculation:"
