QF_CDESK_DEFAULT="All calculation logic is located in the math fields setting, each of which contains a segment of the final mathematical line. By dynamically embedding and removing fields, or changing the value, the user changes the calculator's final line of calculation. You can use the following characters: 0-9()-.+<>!=:?*/|%&v.<br><br>The advantage of this method is that it doesn't have a formula and doesn't depend on the field id. Accordingly, one field can be used many times in the same form in different places with different values. Your task is to place the brackets correctly without causing calculation errors. If-else-type conditions can be set using dependent fields, or by using +(v>10?20:10) type. You can use hidden fields to write more complex logic.<br><br>This method calculates only one result. This method will not work if the calculation must include the field twice, for example, x*(x+y)+y*(x+y), where x and y are repeated."

QF_CDESK_MULTIPL="This method also brings the mathematical logic into the math field settings. The difference is the presence of a defining formula and the ability to display several calculator results, the ability to change the order, the ability to use fields selectively, the ability to use a field several times in a formula, for example, 3.4={2.2}*{1.1}+{2.3}*{1.1}. <br><br>Specify a formula like 4.31={4.25}{4.27}*2+({3.15}+{1.25}){4.2}, where 4.31= is the fieldid calculatorSum that the formula is associated with. {4.25} - fieldid of the field, instead of which the value from math will be substituted (number or mathematical expression). The semicolon is the formula separator. If the field is not found, it will be ignored.<br><br>To display multiple results, use a formula like:<br><br>width={4.27}{3.15};<br>4.25=( {7.0} >= 10?100:200){7.1};<br>4.58={4.25}{4.27}{4.25}+{width};<br>5.7=3.14*{3.16}*{3.16} /2+{4.25}({4.27}||{2.15});<br>9.12={width}*{5.7}<br><br>The following characters can be used in this method: 0-9( )-.+<>!=:?*/|%&."

QF_CDESK_SIMPLE="This variant uses the common logic. It completely transfers the math to the formula. Instead of mathematical expressions in math fields, you need to enter the variable name there. For example, width in the first field and height in the second. The formula for calculating half the area will then look like this: 4.31={width}*{height}/2. The formula for calculating the area of a circle will look like this: 4.32=3.14*{d}*{d}/4, where d is a variable , assigned to a field with a diameter.<br><br> The disadvantage is that the calculator considers only fillable fields of the type number, text, range.<br><br>Like the previous version, this method can display several results. To do this, display the function field calculatorSum several times."

QF_CDESK_CUSTOM="All previous calculators consider the form on the js of the client, and after it is sent, they check it by recalculating the fields on the server. The proposed method always counts on the server, sending a request by Ajax every time the form changes. The calculation formula is written directly in the php language. It is enough to write only include (the path to the file with logic) in the formula. This option is the most functional.<br><br>An example of calculating the cone:"
